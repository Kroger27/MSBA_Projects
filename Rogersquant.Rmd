This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

#Questions 1-3 
```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
x <- read.lp("Quant2.lp")
x

```

```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective(x)
```
```{r}
get.dual.solution(x)
get.sensitivity.rhs(x)
```

```{r}
get.variables(x)
```

```{r}
get.constraints(x)
```
# Question 4
```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
y <- read.lp("Quant3.lp")
y
```
```{r}
solve(y)
get.objective(y)
```

```{r}
get.constraints(y)
```

```{r}
get.variables(y)
```
# Question 5
```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
z <- read.lp("Quant4.lp")
z
```
```{r}
solve(z)
get.objective(z)
```
```{r}
get.constraints(z)
```

```{r}
get.variables(z)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
